## Benchmark Summary

| Benchmark Name | Iterations | ns/op (lower is better) | MB/s (higher is better) | B/op (lower is better) | allocs/op (lower is better) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BenchmarkHighVolumeTransfer-12` | 4149 | 272858 | 240.18 | 1238 | 19 |

## Performance Analysis

	### CPU Usage

	To analyze CPU usage, run the following command:

	```sh
	go tool pprof cpu.prof
	```

	*TODO: Add automated analysis of top CPU consuming functions here.*

	### Memory Usage

	To analyze memory allocation, run the following command:

	```sh
	go tool pprof mem.prof
	```

	*TODO: Add automated analysis of top memory allocating functions here.*

	### Bottlenecks & Spikes

	*TODO: This section would contain analysis of detected performance bottlenecks or significant spikes in resource usage during the benchmark run. This requires more sophisticated analysis of the pprof data.*

	### WASM Performance

	As requested, a separate web server for WASM benchmarking will be implemented. This server will provide a browser-based environment to measure performance and report the results as an HTML page.

	See the `BENCHMARK.md` file for more details.
